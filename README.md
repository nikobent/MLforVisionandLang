# MLforVisionandLang
In this repository I include the assignments for the course Machine Learning for Human Vision and Language.
First assignment in R and second in Python

The first Lab assignment was focused on human vision. The exercises studied convolution in R.
First we used keras for our Convolutions and then implemented the underlying functions from Scratch.

The second Lab assignment was focused on language. The exercise studied word-embeddings and especially the GloVe embeddings.
Using python we created an implementation of these vectors.
